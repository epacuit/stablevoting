   * to optimize the iterative methods, I am currently using the private compiled methods
     _borda_score and _find_updated_profiles. We should think of a better way to deal with this issue. 
   * implement other voting methods: e.g., Dodgson, Young, Kemeny
   * implement the linear programming version of Ranked Pairs: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06992.pdf
   * implement a Voting Method class?
